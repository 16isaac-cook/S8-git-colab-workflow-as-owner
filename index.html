            <div id="what" class="content">
                <p>Pathfinder and Dungeons & Dragons are both tabletop roleplaying games. 
                    Each one has pros and cons and are each fun in their own way.
                    Pathfinder was originally created as a spinoff of Dungeons and Dragons,
                    which was allowed due to Dungeons and Dragons' Open Gaming License that
                    allows for third-party content creation and monetization.
                </p>
                <p>Pathfinder was created by longtime D&D players in 2009 as a version with
                    a handful of homerules. Eventually it became a full blown project, and
                    has started to become incredibly popular in the TTRPG scene as an
                    alternative to D&D.

        <div class="dropdown">
            <div class="trigger">Which should you play?</div>
            <div id="which" class="content">
                <p>The two systems are very similar. Each one has a focus on fantasy settings
                    involving battling monsters and going on quests. This can make it difficult
                    to really know which one is for you, since on the box they appear so samey.
                </p>
                <p>When trying to decide which game is best for you and your players, the number
                    one thing I would recommend is asking yourself just how experienced you are
                    with TTRPG games in general. Pathfinder is much better suited to experienced
                    players in the game genre, offering a much more robust character creation system,
                    while D&D is much better suited to those who just want to get their hands on the game
                    and start playing no matter the experience level.
                </p>

        <div class="dropdown">
            <div class="trigger">Character creation</div>
            <div id="creation" class="content">
                <p>The big difference between the two games is in the character creation. This is where
                    Pathfinder tends to shine a bit better, offering a plethora of character options
                    that D&D doesn't have. That's not to say that D&D's character creation is worse,
                    just less complex which allows it to be much easier to grasp for newer players.
                </p>
                <p>The part of Pathfinder's character creation that really sets it apart is the feat system.
                    At every step of your character's creation, you are able to choose from dozens of feats per level.
                    These feats can be related to your character's ancestry, class, and even skills, really allowing you
                    to flesh out every aspect of your character's abilities. D&D, on the other hand, has options in a similar
                    way, but doesn't hold a candle to the sheer number of options available in Pathfinder.

            <div class="trigger">Running the game</div>
            <div id="running" class="content">
                <p>Another important aspect of any roleplaying game is the ability for the game master to run the game itself.
                    From my experience playing the two games, Pathfinder has a more difficult barrier of entry, but once
                    you bypass that barrier it becomes far easier to run the game from the game master's chair. There are dozens of moments I can think of where a player asked me, "Can I do that?" during a game of D&D,
                    and, as the person running the game, I was unfortunately forced to come up with this answer on the spot.
                    Sure, that's part of the game, but sometimes it's an action that just feels like it should be part of the rules
                    already, and not something I should have to come up with on my own.
                </p>
                <p> This is where Pathfinder shines for the game master. An almost unnecessary amount of rules exist already in the game
                    for these situations, just so a game master who is well versed in the game itself doesn't have to come up with rulings like
                    that on their own. Sure, it takes time to learn this much larger amount of rules, but once you do the games runs much more smoothly.
                    For instance, a common thing that will always come up in a longer running game is crafting. D&D currently has no built in rules for crafting,
                    which seems strange considering the amount of mechanics that a game master would have to come up with themselves regarding this topic. Pathfinder,
                    on the other hand, saw this issue and said, "Hey, we'll give you multiple pages of the manual just on crafting mechanics," just so that when one
                    of your players inevitably wants to craft something the ability to do so is quickly at hand.

            <div class="trigger">My personal opinion</div>
            <div id="opinion" class="content">
                <p>I've played D&D for almost seven years at this point, and have only recently started playing Pathfinder
                    over the last few months. My group thought it could be interesting to give it a try, and boy am I glad
                    we did! I love this game in so many ways, and a big reason for that is the robust character creation available.
                </p>
                <p>I've only made one character in Pathfinder so far, and even just make that one I struggled between around 5 or 6
                    different ideas, and that's just within the one class I chose out of the over a dozen different options! The more I
                    look into this game, the more I want to play it, and for that reason I think it will be my go to TTRPG for the foreseeable
                    future.
